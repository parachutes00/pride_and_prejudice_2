<br><br><p>In this page, I'm pursuing the journey of finding
<strong>Why I love "Pride & Prejudice."</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top:30px;">I love this work both in novel and film.
<br>I was 15 when I first watched the film of "Pride & Prejudice"
<br>I was in a Saturday Club at school, where I watch movies with the members on Saturdays
<br>"Pride & Prejudice" was one of the movies I watched during those times
<br>and it was the only one that I can remember till now from the list of those I wathced at the club.
<br>Then, <strong>what aspects of this movie captivated my attention?</strong></p>
